<h1>Single Price Grid Component (HTML/CSS)</h1>

This is a starting point project where I built a single component.

<ul>
  Mentions:
  <li>You can view the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size</li>
  <li>You can see a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action</li>
  <li>You can see Learning Outcomes</li>
  <li>Although small, this project presents some nice layout challenges. I used this opportunity to practice Flexbox and CSS Grid.</li>
</ul>
